## CMIP7 Data Request Content

This repo is used to version control the information ("content") used in the data request.
Airtable bases maintained by the CMIP IPO and data request task team are the primary current source of this information.
These Airtable bases are used to manage the information gathered by the extensive community consultation being undertaken to develop of the CMIP7 Harmonised AR7 Fast Track data request.

Information exported from the Airtable bases is stored in this repo (and also the scripts used to export it).
This includes information on the variables requested for each CMIP7 experiment, as well as the detailed specifications (metadata attributes) of the requested variables.
The software used to manipulate this information is managed separately, [in this repo](https://github.com/CMIP-Data-Request/CMIP7_DReq_Software).
